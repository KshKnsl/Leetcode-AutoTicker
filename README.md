## What if you had a tool that could tick the problems you solved on leetcode in the UI of any website?

LeetCode Auto Ticker is a Chrome extension that automatically marks (✔️) the LeetCode problems you've solved, directly in the UI of any websites—including Take U Forward sheets and any site with LeetCode problem links or sheets.
